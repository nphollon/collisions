# collisions

This is a library for collision detection in 2D and 3D. It is designed to work with the
vector data types in
[johnpmayer/elm-linear-algebra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/johnpmayer/elm-linear-algebra/2.0.2)

The library only detects collisions between convex hulls and points. Full detection between two hulls is not yet supported.

[Here is an example.](https://nphollon.github.io/collisions.html)
